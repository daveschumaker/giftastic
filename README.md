# giftastic
A simple NodeJS web app that returns a random GIF on page load.

Initially, I created this app to practice setting up a bare bones HTTP server in Node.js as part of our coursework at [Hack Reactor](http://www.hackreactor.com/). 

As it turns out, that was pretty easy. I decided to take it to the next level and add some routing.

That was easy, too. Okay, let's get some practice with some MVC architecture. And so, giftastic was born.
